# socketio-twitter-streaming
A simple Twitter streaming search client.

# Run it
Before you can run this you'll have to have a Twitter account with access
to their streaming api. Download the repo, install the app with NPM,
put your credentials in the index.js file, and run 'node index.js'. The
application is served on port 3000 by default, but you can change it.
